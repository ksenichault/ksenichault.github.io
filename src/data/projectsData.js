 I built a dataset of 4,500 curated images across 9 princess classes, splitting it into 80% training and 20% testing. Each frame was cropped around the character present in the frame with the YOLO algorithm, excluding irrelevant content. To improve robustness, I applied a rich data augmentation pipeline (noise, blur, lighting variation, flips, rotations, zoom, etc.), ensuring the models could generalize well to new inputs." },
